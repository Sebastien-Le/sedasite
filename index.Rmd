title: "SEDA: Sensory Evaluation Data Analysis with jamovi and FactoMineR"
---

SEDA is jamovi module for sensory evaluation data analysis methods with two types of perception data : the first one describes stimuli according to a fixed list of attributes (QDA data, for instance) such as the characterization of the stimulus space, its representation or the identification of the defects, the second one describes stimuli freely by napping or sorting data.
