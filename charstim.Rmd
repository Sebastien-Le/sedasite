The first method of the **Fixed List of Attributes** submenu is the characterization of the stimulus space according to a fixed list of attributes.
```{r catdes1, out.width="80%", fig.align="left", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/charstim1.png")
```
<br><br />

## **The interface**
As it can be seen in the figure above, the interface is very simple and only has 4 fields you need to worry about.
<br><br />
```{r catdes2, out.width="60%", fig.align="left", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/charstim2.png")
```
Firstly, you put the variable __*Stimulus Effect*__ , a categorical variable that you wish to analyze. Then, you put the continuous and categorical variables you want to use for the characterization of the variable.
