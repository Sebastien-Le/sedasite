The first method of the **Fixed List of Attributes** submenu is the characterization of the stimulus space according to a fixed list of attributes.

```{r catdes1, out.width="80%", fig.align="left", echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/charstim1.png")
```
<br><br />

## **The interface**
As it can be seen in the figure above, the interface is very simple and only has 4 fields you need to worry about.
<br><br />
```{r catdes2, out.width="90%", fig.align="left", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/charstim2.png")
```

Firstly, you put the variable __*Stimulus Effect*__ , a variable that...

## **Potential issue(s)**
For the analysis to run smoothly, make sure that...

## **Example**
For this example, we will be using gain the chocolate data set (available with SEDA).
```{r descfreq3, out.width="60%", fig.align="left", echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(c("images/descfreq3.png","images/descfreq4.png"))
```
